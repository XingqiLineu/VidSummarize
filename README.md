# VidSummarize

A Flexible, Portable Video Summarization and Interactive QA System

## Overview

This project is a flexible, portable video transcription and summarization tool inspired by Notegpt. It leverages **AssemblyAI** for transcription and a fine-tuned **OpenAI GPT-4o mini** model for summarization and interactive Q&A. The system is built on **Langflow**, with custom enhancements for modularity and portability. Users can upload video/audio, obtain transcripts and summaries, and interact with the content using powerful LLM-based chat.

## Features

- **Video/Audio Transcription:**
  Converts video or audio files into accurate text using AssemblyAI.
- **Automated Summarization:**
  Generates concise summaries with a fine-tuned OpenAI GPT-4o mini model.
- **Interactive Q&A:**
  Enables chat-based exploration of transcripts and summaries.
- **Prompt Engineering & Workflow Chains:**
  Utilizes advanced prompt strategies and modular workflow chains for robust performance.
- **Custom Langflow Components:**
  Enhanced and extended Langflow components for improved flexibility and portability.

## Architecture

![architecture diagram](https://s2.loli.net/2025/04/21/mTbV7ilDRE1fNUk.png)

- **Workflow 1:**
  Transcribe video/audio with AssemblyAI â†’ Summarize with fine-tuned GPT-4o mini
- **Workflow 2:**
  Use transcript/summary for interactive chat-based Q&A

## Quickstart

https://huggingface.co/spaces/fucn569/Langflow

## Prerequisites

- [AssemblyAI API Key](https://www.assemblyai.com/)
- [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/)

## Steps

1. click https://huggingface.co/spaces/fucn569/Langflow
2. Configure your API keys. (API keys have already been provided on this interface.)
3. Upload your audio/video file or link (most common formats supported).
4. Click "Run" on the **Transcript** or **Summary** output nodes to get results.
5. Use the **Playground** chat window for interactive Q&A about your content.

## Key Technologies

- **Langflow:** Visual workflow builder for LLM applications.
- **AssemblyAI:** Speech-to-text transcription API.
- **OpenAI GPT-4o mini:** Fine-tuned for domain-specific summarization and Q&A.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Systematic prompt and context management.
- **Custom Components:** Extended Langflow modules for improved usability.

## Limitations & Known Issues

- **YouTube Integration:**
  Automated YouTube audio extraction (using `yt_dlp`) is only supported in local environments due to server restrictions. For public deployments, manual upload is required.
  - Details: https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/issues/5486
  
- **API Key Required:**
  Users must provide their own AssemblyAI and OpenAI API keys.

## Example Output

- **Transcript:**
  Full text transcription of uploaded video/audio.
- **Summary:**
  Concise, context-aware summary generated by fine-tuned LLM.
- **Q&A:**
  Interactive chat with transcript and summary context.

## Setup & Usage (Hugging Face Spaces)

```text
Duplicate the LangFlow Space.

Set the global variable LANGFLOW_REMOVE_API_KEYS to false in the space settings or remove it entirely.
